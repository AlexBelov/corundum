PART

CHAPTER
I
THE
TRAIL
OF
THE
MEAT
Dark
spruce
forest
frowned
on
either
side
the
frozen
waterway
The
trees
had
been
stripped
by
a
recent
wind
of
their
white
covering
of
frost
and
they
seemed
to
lean
towards
each
other
black
and
ominous
in
the
fading
light
A
vast
silence
reigned
over
the
land
The
land
itself
was
a
desolation
lifeless
without
movement
so
lone
and
cold
that
the
spirit
of
it
was
not
even
that
of
sadness
There
was
a
hint
in
it
of
laughter
but
of
a
laughter
more
terrible
than
any
sadnessa
laughter
that
was
mirthless
as
the
smile
of
the
sphinx
a
laughter
cold
as
the
frost
and
partaking
of
the
grimness
of
infallibility
It
was
the
masterful
and
incommunicable
wisdom
of
eternity
laughing
at
the
futility
of
life
and
the
effort
of
life
It
was
the
Wild
the
savage
frozenhearted
Northland
Wild
But
there
was
life
abroad
in
the
land
and
defiant
Down
the
frozen
waterway
toiled
a
string
of
wolfish
dogs
Their
bristly
fur
was
rimed
with
frost
Their
breath
froze
in
the
air
as
it
left
their
mouths
spouting
forth
in
spumes
of
vapour
that
settled
upon
the
hair
of
their
bodies
and
formed
into
crystals
of
frost
Leather
harness
was
on
the
dogs
and
leather
traces
attached
them
to
a
sled
which
dragged
along
behind
The
sled
was
without
runners
It
was
made
of
stout
birchbark
and
its
full
surface
rested
on
the
snow
The
front
end
of
the
sled
was
turned
up
like
a
scroll
in
order
to
force
down
and
under
the
bore
of
soft
snow
that
surged
like
a
wave
before
it
On
the
sled
securely
lashed
was
a
long
and
narrow
oblong
box
There
were
other
things
on
the
sledblankets
an
axe
and
a
coffeepot
and
fryingpan
but
prominent
occupying
most
of
the
space
was
the
long
and
narrow
oblong
box
In
advance
of
the
dogs
on
wide
snowshoes
toiled
a
man
At
the
rear
of
the
sled
toiled
a
second
man
On
the
sled
in
the
box
lay
a
third
man
whose
toil
was
overa
man
whom
the
Wild
had
conquered
and
beaten
down
until
he
would
never
move
nor
struggle
again
It
is
not
the
way
of
the
Wild
to
like
movement
Life
is
an
offence
to
it
for
life
is
movement
and
the
Wild
aims
always
to
destroy
movement
It
freezes
the
water
to
prevent
it
running
to
the
sea
it
drives
the
sap
out
of
the
trees
till
they
are
frozen
to
their
mighty
hearts
and
most
ferociously
and
terribly
of
all
does
the
Wild
harry
and
crush
into
submission
manman
who
is
the
most
restless
of
life
ever
in
revolt
against
the
dictum
that
all
movement
must
in
the
end
come
to
the
cessation
of
movement
But
at
front
and
rear
unawed
and
indomitable
toiled
the
two
men
who
were
not
yet
dead
Their
bodies
were
covered
with
fur
and
softtanned
leather
Eyelashes
and
cheeks
and
lips
were
so
coated
with
the
crystals
from
their
frozen
breath
that
their
faces
were
not
discernible
This
gave
them
the
seeming
of
ghostly
masques
undertakers
in
a
spectral
world
at
the
funeral
of
some
ghost
But
under
it
all
they
were
men
penetrating
the
land
of
desolation
and
mockery
and
silence
puny
adventurers
bent
on
colossal
adventure
pitting
themselves
against
the
might
of
a
world
as
remote
and
alien
and
pulseless
as
the
abysses
of
space
They
travelled
on
without
speech
saving
their
breath
for
the
work
of
their
bodies
On
every
side
was
the
silence
pressing
upon
them
with
a
tangible
presence
It
affected
their
minds
as
the
many
atmospheres
of
deep
water
affect
the
body
of
the
diver
It
crushed
them
with
the
weight
of
unending
vastness
and
unalterable
decree
It
crushed
them
into
the
remotest
recesses
of
their
own
minds
pressing
out
of
them
like
juices
from
the
grape
all
the
false
ardours
and
exaltations
and
undue
selfvalues
of
the
human
soul
until
they
perceived
themselves
finite
and
small
specks
and
motes
moving
with
weak
cunning
and
little
wisdom
amidst
the
play
and
interplay
of
the
great
blind
elements
and
forces
An
hour
went
by
and
a
second
hour
The
pale
light
of
the
short
sunless
day
was
beginning
to
fade
when
a
faint
far
cry
arose
on
the
still
air
It
soared
upward
with
a
swift
rush
till
it
reached
its
topmost
note
where
it
persisted
palpitant
and
tense
and
then
slowly
died
away
It
might
have
been
a
lost
soul
wailing
had
it
not
been
invested
with
a
certain
sad
fierceness
and
hungry
eagerness
The
front
man
turned
his
head
until
his
eyes
met
the
eyes
of
the
man
behind
And
then
across
the
narrow
oblong
box
each
nodded
to
the
other
A
second
cry
arose
piercing
the
silence
with
needlelike
shrillness
Both
men
located
the
sound
It
was
to
the
rear
somewhere
in
the
snow
expanse
they
had
just
traversed
A
third
and
answering
cry
arose
also
to
the
rear
and
to
the
left
of
the
second
cry
Theyre
after
us
Bill
said
the
man
at
the
front
His
voice
sounded
hoarse
and
unreal
and
he
had
spoken
with
apparent
effort
Meat
is
scarce
answered
his
comrade
I
aint
seen
a
rabbit
sign
for
days
Thereafter
they
spoke
no
more
though
their
ears
were
keen
for
the
huntingcries
that
continued
to
rise
behind
them
At
